# Websites for Recipes 

## Deciding what websites to use to find the yummy breakfast recipes 

Since this is an *exciting day* filled with copious amounts of food and possibly fun friends, you need to decide what food will be served? Will you go the healthier route of kale smoothies and chickpea pancakes or will you go for the cinnamon encrusted praline French toast? [**Buzzfeed**](https://www.buzzfeed.com/) and [**Tasty**](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasty) are just  few of the trending food recipe websites that also include videos to help as you create the meal.

### My Suggested Websites 
Over the years I have tried my hand at creating different meals here & there. The websites that you should use are: 

* [Country Living](www.countryliving.com/breakfast-recipes)
* [Delish](www.delish.com/breakfast-ideas)
