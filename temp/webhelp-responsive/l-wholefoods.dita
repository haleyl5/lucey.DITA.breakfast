    can, but I sure can't! Whole Foods and Trader Joes have taken the health food store market by
    storm. They offer delicious food choices that are good for your health and your taste buds! In
    order to make your breakfast you should take a trip to these stores to get needed ingredients. </shortdesc>

      options they offer. Pick a time when you have a few hours to dedicate. </p>

      needed items. Make sure you are generous with the amount of food you purchase, it's always
      better to have too much than too little.</p>
