#Setting up for Brunch

Appreance makes a **big** difference when enjoying a hearty breakfast. Making sure the place is neat and tidy is just they beginning. Setting the table and adding a nice floral arrangment is always a great idea. 

## Setting the table 
Check back on the guest list and see how many people will be joining you. Next grab the appropriate amount of dishes, silverware, and glasses and set them out neatly on the table.

## Floral Arrangment
I always enjoy my meal a little more if the table is aesthetically appealing. Decide what type of flower you love the most a grab a few to add to a vase.
